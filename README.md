# Rules
## Letters
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p r s t u v z  
(q,w,x,y,sh,zh,ph) are omitted 
## Words
All letters which are written but are not pronouced are removed including e at the end of some words.
## Grammar
There is no irregular thing anywhere. For example all past tenses are (present tens+ 'ed')
 
| Before | After | Before Example | After Example | Description |
|--------|-------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| an | a | I ate ~~`an`~~ orange | I ate `a` orange | Never use `an` |
| knows | know | He ~~`knows`~~ | He `know` | Never use `s` for singular third person |
| doesn't | don't | He ~~`doesn't`~~ know | He `don't` know | Never use `does` for singular third person |
| has | have | He ~~`has`~~ been there | He `have` been there | Never use `has` for singular third person |
| it is | it | It ~~`is`~~ an example | It a exmple | Never use `is` after it |
| wrote | writed | I ~~`wrote`~~ this | I `writed` this | Simple past tense by adding `ed` |

## Vocabulary
| Before | After | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| This / That | it | Always use `it` instead of `this` or `that` |

## Pronunciation
I'm not going to write full phonetics here and instead just show them with simple characters.
| Sentence | Before | After | Description |
|----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| The book | `The` book | `De` book | Always pronounce `the` like `De` (Don't use your teeth and simply say De) |
| The orange | ~~`Di`~~ orange | `De` orange | Never change the pronunciation of the word `De` to `Di` when encountering vowels

## Example
#### Before
```This is an example text wrote for you to check if it works. If you understand it, it means he or she undertands it too. So no need to use the difficult traditional English version```

#### After
```It a example text writed for you to check if it work. If you understand it, it mean he or she understand it too. So no need to use the difficult traditional English version.```
